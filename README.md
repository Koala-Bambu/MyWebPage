this page is mostly for my own development and its just a "student project" dont expect big things.

I LITERALLY DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING
Day1:
created a main page and set its background to a placeholder image, managed to create two buttons they currently hold no functionality, html is hard and i dont know how to css.
Day2:
i added functionality to one of the buttons, it now send to the art page, the main page goes hard still thinking of a background a little secrets to sprinkle somewhere
if anyone knows css and html please msg me, i cant pay but just a little guidance helps, you dont even need to teach if you know of anywhere one could start learning it would also be apretiated
